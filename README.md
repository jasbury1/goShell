# goshell

A WIP package with some fun stuff planned! Stay tuned...

As it is now, this shell is as straightforward as I could make it while still remaining useful. This means it supports unix commands, file redirection for input/output, and pipelines for any number of connected commands.

This was originally created as a playgroud for me to learn a few of Go's OS/Systems features.
